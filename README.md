## Nextcloud Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- A Nextcloud server (self-hosted or provider-hosted)
- WiFi connection for initial setup and uploads (if WiFi-only mode is enabled)

### Step 1: Create a Nextcloud Public Share

1. **Log into Nextcloud** web interface
2. **Navigate** to the folder where you want photos uploaded
   - Example: `Photos/Field Work` or `Documents/Survey Data`
3. **Create the folder** if it doesn't exist
4. Click the **Share** icon (🔗) next to the folder
5. Under **"Share link"**, click **"Create public link"**
6. **Enable permissions**:
   - ✅ **Check "Allow upload and editing"** (critical!)
   - ⚠️ This allows the app to upload files to this folder
7. **(Optional) Set a password** for added security
   - Recommended if you're concerned about the share link being discovered
8. **Copy the share URL**
   - It will look like: `https://cloud.example.com/index.php/s/AbCdEfGh123456`
   - Save this URL - you'll need it for the app

> 💡 **Tip**: Use a dedicated folder for camera uploads to keep your photos organized

### Step 2: Configure Linked Camera

1. **Open Linked Camera**
2. **Go to Settings**:
   - Tap the ⚙️ Settings icon
   - Navigate to **"Linked Camera Settings"**
   - Tap **"Server settings..."**

3. **Enable Auto-Upload**:
   - Toggle **"Nextcloud Auto-Upload"** to ON

4. **Enter Share URL**:
   - Tap **"Nextcloud Share URL"**
   - Paste your share URL from Step 1
   - Ensure it includes the full path: `https://cloud.example.com/index.php/s/TOKEN`

5. **(Optional) Enter Password**:
   - If you set a password on the share, tap **"Share Password (optional)"**
   - Enter the password exactly as configured in Nextcloud

6. **Configure Upload Behavior**:
   - 📶 **"WiFi Only"** (recommended): Only upload when connected to WiFi
     - When disabled, will use mobile data (use with caution!)
   - 🗑️ **"Auto-Delete After Upload"**: Delete local copy after successful upload
     - Useful to save device storage
     - ⚠️ Only enable if you're confident uploads are working reliably

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. **Take a test photo**
   - Return to camera view and take a photo
2. **Check notification area**:
   - If WiFi is connected: Should see "Photo uploaded to Nextcloud"
   - If WiFi is off (with WiFi-only enabled): "Queued for WiFi upload"
3. **Verify in Nextcloud**:
   - Open your Nextcloud folder in a web browser
   - The photo should appear within a few seconds
   - Filename format: `IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg`

> ✅ **Success!** If you see the photo in Nextcloud, your setup is complete!

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues

**"Upload failed" notification**
- Verify the share URL is correct (check for typos)
- Ensure "Allow upload and editing" is enabled on the share
- Check if the Nextcloud server is accessible
- Try opening the share URL in a web browser to verify it works

**Photos not uploading automatically**
- Check if WiFi is connected (if WiFi-only mode is enabled)
- Verify auto-upload is enabled in settings
- Check if the share password is correct (if set)
- Try manually processing the queue

**Large queue not processing**
- Connect to a stable WiFi network
- Keep the app open (or in recent apps) during upload
- Check available server storage quota

### Camera Issues

**Camera not starting**
- Grant camera permission in Android settings
- Close other camera apps
- Restart the device

**GPS location not appearing**
- Grant location permission
- Enable device location (GPS)
- Wait for GPS lock (may take a minute outdoors)
- Ensure geotagging is enabled in settings

**Bluetooth remote not working**
- Grant Bluetooth permissions
- Enable Bluetooth on device
- Ensure remote is in pairing mode
- Try rescanning for devices

## Field Workflow Tips

### Pre-Field Preparation

1. Configure Nextcloud connection and verify it works
2. Enable geotagging (Settings → Location settings)
3. Configure photo stamping with your project name
4. Take test photos and verify uploads
5. Download test photos from Nextcloud to verify GPS data

**In the Field:**
1. Take photos normally - they'll queue automatically
2. GPS data embeds automatically (if enabled)
3. Check queue count in notification area
4. Photos upload when you return to WiFi

**Post-Field:**
1. Connect to WiFi at office/home
2. Photos upload automatically from queue
3. Verify all uploads in Nextcloud
4. Organize and process as needed

### Battery Optimization

- Disable unnecessary on-screen displays (Settings → On screen GUI)
- Use WiFi-only mode (saves battery vs constant mobile data)
- Turn off geotagging if GPS data isn't needed
- Consider enabling auto-delete to reduce storage writes
- Use airplane mode in the field, enable WiFi when ready to upload

### Storage Management

- Enable auto-delete if device storage is limited
- Monitor queue size - large queues can use significant storage
- Manually clear queue after verifying uploads: Settings → Process Upload Queue
- Check Nextcloud storage quota regularly

A: No. Linked Camera only uploads to the Nextcloud server YOU configure. There is no analytics, telemetry, or data collection of any kind.

**Q: Can I use this without Nextcloud?**
A: Yes! Nextcloud upload is completely optional. You can use Linked Camera as a regular camera app.

**Q: What happens if I lose internet connection while uploading?**
A: The current upload will fail, but the photo remains in the queue. It will retry when WiFi reconnects.

**Q: Can I upload videos to Nextcloud?**
A: Currently, only JPEG images are uploaded. Video support may be added in future versions.

**Q: Does this work with other cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive)?**
A: No, currently only Nextcloud is supported via WebDAV public shares.

**Q: Is the GPS location accurate?**
A: GPS accuracy depends on your device and environmental conditions. Clear sky view provides best accuracy (typically 3-10m).

**Q: Can I customize the upload folder structure?**
A: Photos upload to the root of the configured Nextcloud share folder. You can organize them manually in Nextcloud afterward.

**Q: What format are the uploaded photos?**
